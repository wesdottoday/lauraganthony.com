## Talk Description

Automated accessibility testing tools are a great starting point, but they only catch about 25% of accessibility issues. This hands-on workshop will teach you comprehensive testing strategies that ensure your digital products truly work for users with disabilities.

You'll learn manual testing techniques, get hands-on experience with assistive technologies, and develop testing protocols that can be seamlessly integrated into your development workflow. This isn't just theory—you'll leave with practical skills and a testing toolkit you can use immediately.

Through interactive exercises and real-world examples, we'll explore the limitations of automated tools and discover how manual testing and user feedback can provide insights that transform your accessibility practices.

## Workshop Structure

This intensive session combines presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on practice to give you comprehensive accessibility testing skills.

### Part 1: Understanding the Testing Landscape (20 minutes)

#### The Reality of Automated Testing
- What automated tools can and cannot detect
- Common false positives and missed issues
- Integration strategies for automated accessibility testing
- Building automated testing into CI/CD pipelines

#### Manual Testing Fundamentals
- The testing pyramid for accessibility
- Risk assessment and prioritization strategies
- Documentation and reporting best practices
- Creating reproducible test scenarios

### Part 2: Hands-On Assistive Technology Testing (40 minutes)

#### Screen Reader Testing
Live demonstrations and hands-on practice with:
- **NVDA** (Windows): Installation, basic navigation, testing forms and interactive elements
- **VoiceOver** (macOS): Quick navigation, rotor usage, testing complex widgets
- **JAWS** (Windows): Form mode, virtual cursor, testing data tables
- **TalkBack** (Android): Mobile-specific testing scenarios

#### Other Assistive Technologies
- Voice control software testing and dictation workflows
- Switch navigation and single-switch testing
- Keyboard-only navigation beyond basic tab order
- Screen magnification software and zoom testing
