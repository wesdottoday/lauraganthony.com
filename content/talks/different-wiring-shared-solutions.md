summary: "Conflict is inevitable, and the stress it creates can be particularly challenging for neurodivergent individuals who process emotions, interpret communication, and respond to tension in different ways. For dispute resolution professionals, like mediators and arbitrators, as well as workplace leaders, it's important to understand these differences and how traditional ADR practices can create barriers to resolution. This training offers practitioners insight on how to eliminate these barriers, implement inclusive practices that account for diverse thinking and communication styles and achieve better solutions for all parties."
takeaways:
  - "Recognize how neurodivergence can affect how people experience stress and conflict"
  - "Understand how traditional approaches to dispute resolution may be ineffective or escalate the tension between parties"
  - "Learn how to adapt processes so they support all participants and their unique needs"

## Talk Description

Conflict is inevitable in any workplace or relationship, and the stress it creates can be particularly challenging for neurodivergent individuals who process emotions, interpret communication, and respond to tension in fundamentally different ways. For dispute resolution professionals—mediators, arbitrators, ombuds—as well as workplace leaders, understanding these differences isn't just helpful, it's essential for effective resolution.

Traditional Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) practices, while well-intentioned, can inadvertently create barriers to resolution when they don't account for neurodivergent processing styles. What works for neurotypical participants may actually escalate tension or prevent meaningful engagement for others.

This training offers practitioners and leaders insight into how to eliminate these barriers, implement inclusive practices that account for diverse thinking and communication styles, and achieve better, more sustainable solutions for all parties involved.

## What You'll Learn

Through case studies and practical exercises, attendees will gain:

### Understanding Neurodivergent Conflict Experiences
- **Stress processing differences**: How neurodivergent individuals experience and respond to conflict
- **Communication barriers**: Recognizing when traditional approaches create obstacles
- **Sensory considerations**: Environmental factors that impact participation
- **Executive function impacts**: How stress affects planning and decision-making

### Adaptive Resolution Strategies
- **Process modifications**: Adjusting mediation and arbitration procedures
- **Communication adaptations**: Multiple ways to ensure understanding and participation
- **Environmental accommodations**: Creating accessible physical and virtual spaces
- **Timeline flexibility**: Working with different processing speeds and needs

### Enhanced Practitioner Skills
- **Recognition techniques**: Identifying when standard approaches aren't working
- **Intervention strategies**: Pivoting methods mid-process when needed
- **Inclusive facilitation**: Ensuring all voices are heard and valued
- **Solution validation**: Confirming understanding and buy-in from all parties

## Real-World Applications

Participants will develop practical competencies including:

- Pre-process screening and preparation techniques
- Environmental and procedural accommodation strategies
- Communication method alternatives (verbal, written, visual)
- De-escalation techniques tailored to neurodivergent stress responses
- Follow-up approaches that ensure lasting resolution
