## Talk Description

In this comprehensive session, we'll explore the fundamental principles that make digital experiences accessible to everyone. Too often, accessibility is treated as an afterthought or a compliance checkbox, but when we design with inclusion from the start, we create better experiences for all users.

This talk will transform how you think about design by showing you that accessible design isn't about limitations—it's about expanding possibilities. You'll learn practical strategies for implementing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in your daily work, discover common accessibility pitfalls, and understand how to test your designs effectively.

This talk includes live demonstrations of assistive technologies and real-world examples from major brands who have successfully implemented accessible design practices.
