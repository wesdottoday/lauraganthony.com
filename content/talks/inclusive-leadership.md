## Talk Description

Leading accessibility initiatives requires more than technical knowledge—it demands the ability to inspire change, advocate effectively, and build sustainable systems that prioritize inclusion. This keynote session explores the leadership skills and strategies needed to transform your organization's approach to accessibility.

Drawing from real-world case studies and proven methodologies, we'll examine how successful leaders have navigated organizational challenges, secured buy-in from stakeholders, and created lasting cultural change. You'll learn how to position accessibility as a business imperative, not just a compliance requirement.
