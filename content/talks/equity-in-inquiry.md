## Talk Description

HR professionals and leaders conduct countless interviews throughout their careers—for hiring, workplace investigations, performance evaluations, and more. These conversations are critical decision points that shape careers, resolve conflicts, and determine organizational outcomes. Yet traditional interview techniques, while familiar and comfortable, can inadvertently disadvantage those who are neurodivergent, leading to missed talent opportunities and potentially flawed investigative outcomes.

With 1 in 5 people identifying as neurodivergent, and with neurodiversity increasingly recognized as a strategic organizational asset, HR professionals and leaders need to evolve their approach. The goal isn't to lower standards or compromise thoroughness—it's to conduct interviews in ways that work for all communication and cognitive styles, ultimately improving the quality and reliability of information gathered.

This session teaches practical strategies to adapt traditional interview approaches, helping leaders understand how inclusive interviewing practices can enhance both talent assessment and fact-finding while ensuring fair and equitable treatment for all participants.
