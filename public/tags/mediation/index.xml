For dispute resolution professionals, like mediators and arbitrators, as well as workplace leaders, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand these differences and how traditional ADR practices can create barriers to resolution. This training offers practitioners insight on how to eliminate these barriers, implement inclusive practices that account for diverse thinking and communication styles and achieve better solutions for all parties.</description></item></channel></rss>
